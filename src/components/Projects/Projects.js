                Leafs Adventure was a mobile platformer game I developed for unity as a senior project in college.
                This was a really enjoyable programming experience for me as gaming has always been a hobby of mine.
                The game was inspired by classic games like Super Mario bros and the Legend of Zelda.

                  A large number of the applications I have supported have been internal applications.
                  Most of these are .NET web services that support the day to day business functionality.
                  I've also worked internally with SQL Server, Split IO, Azure DevOps, TFS, Git and more.
