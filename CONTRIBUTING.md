## Contributing to Resume React App

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines a lightweight workflow to make changes, run tests, and submit a patch.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```

2. Install dependencies and run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3. Linting / Formatting

- The project uses plain JavaScript and CSS. Follow existing code style (ES6, readable functions).
- If you add formatting/linting rules, include them in package.json or add config files.

4. Tests

- Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

5. Commit messages

- Use clear, imperative messages, e.g. "Add contact form validation" or "Fix navbar responsive layout".

6. Pull Request

- Push your branch and open a PR against `main` (or default branch).
- Include a concise description of changes and any setup steps.

7. Small changes

- For documentation or small fixes, target a short-lived branch and reference the related issue or context.

Thanks — maintainers will review and provide feedback.
